# Code--Refractor
Horiseon Website:
Purpose of this Collaborative Project for this website, is contribute through editing the pre-exsisting html and css code. Thereby achieving a clear and functional as well as sustainability to the Team Marketing Collaboration or Horiseon Website.

Notes in this README. will help the next coding editor(s) make decisions that best fit the operation of this website and the overall companys online presences. 
Added the image links to the html code
This README only addresses the code fixes in the index.html and the style.css.

HTML fixes were:
Added a Title name in the <title>
Erased line 11 was not a needed html code for this site.
Added specific elements (<nav> <article> <aside>) for the sections in the <body> making my css easier to identify and navigate.
As well as giving names to their functions in css.
Removed unused <ul> <li> elements, simplified lines 22, 25, 28 hrefs.. were unclear as to their unique protocol
made adjustments to the "search-engine-optimization" "online-reputation-mamnagment" and "social-media-marketing making the code cleaner and clearer
  
The assets images in the <aside> float, was asigned that way to better identify the float itself. As well as <div> removals, and <p> edits, to support their function.
In addition to some of the html changes, I added a personal footer, based on my teams work presented in this project.
  
Syle.CSS fixes were:
1."body" content was reduced and relieved from redundants css qualities.
2 "header" was also cleaned and reduce the px in "padding and Margin" to zero, lessening the busy aspects of the css code
3 Majority of the "headers" were label ".header" this allowed the images and inline properties to work efficently. 
4 reduce some of the code in each head. Made direct changes in the css to match and make the html fuctional.
5 Changed a header to "NAV" prooerty to match the html (chose nav because a  team-mate suggested) its foremost use reduces the use of "header" (a redundantcy.
6 The container has an "aside" float that is the element I preferred using (again my colleague helped make that decision), again helping the relationship and clarity of the CSS code.
Making image changes using CSS made working on the "Horiseon" a bit smoother.

Built With:
